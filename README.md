# Platformer from Scratch

I wanted to try out the [new GPU API] in [SDL3] so I thought I'd write a basic platformer
with it. This project uses SDL3 for video, audio and input and uses [Box2D] for physics.
The game logic is implemented using ECS with the [EnTT] library.

A pre-built binary for 64-bit Windows can be found in the releases section on [GitHub].
